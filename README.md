## To get started

1. Make sure you have Python 3 and pipenv installed

2. In the base directory run
   ```
   pipenv install
   ```
3. After the install completes, run

   ```
   pipenv shell
   ```

   This gets you into the virtual environment where you should be able to run

   ```
   python --version
   ```

   and see a number >= 3

   To exit the virtual environment run

   ```
   exit
   ```
